        The idea to build this web app came when I was starting to learn JavaScript, along with RESPONSIVE DESIGN and DESIGN SYSTEM. 
        Currently, I am working on the second phase of this project: a ReactJS PauseMe, where we can have a scalable and improved application.
        The main focus will be to expand the possibilities, such as allowing the inclusion of new scenes from the user side, 
        having the option to turn off the breath guide, change the volume of the video, and so on.
